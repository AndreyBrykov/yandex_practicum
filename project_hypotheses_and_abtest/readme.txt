As an analyst of a large online store, I, together with the marketing department, have prepared a list of hypotheses to increase revenue. 
It is required to prioritize hypotheses, run an A/B test and analyze its results.
To select hypotheses, it was necessary to use the ICE, RICE frameworks to prioritize hypotheses
Based on the results of the A/B test, an analysis was performed and conclusions were drawn.
